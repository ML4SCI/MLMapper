# Deriving planetary surface composition from orbiting observations from spacecraft

<div align="center">


A Google Summer of Code 2023 Project Repository.<br>
The code was written by Sandeepan Dhoundiyal during the Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2023 for the Lunar Prospector project which is a part of the ML4SCI umbrella organization. It was performed under the supervision of Patrick Peplowski (JHUAPL), Mauricio Ayllon Unzueta (NASA Goddard Space Flight Center / Catholic University of America) and Jack Wilson (JHUAPL).</b>
