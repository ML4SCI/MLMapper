A Google Summer of Code 2021 Project Repository.<br>
The actual code represents the work performed by Sofia Strukova during the Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2021 project which is a part of the ML4SCI umbrella organization. It was performed under the supervision of Patrick Peplowski (JHUAPL), Sergei Gleyzer (University of Alabama) and Jason Terry (University of Georgia).</b>

The experiments presented here were made with the use of the datasets described next. For the Moon: albedo map, LPFe (iron map), LPK (potassium map), LPTh (thorium map), and LPTi (titanium) map. For Mercury: the albedo map which is split into the top and bottom of the planet, chemical maps - Al to Si element ratio, Ca to Si element ratio, Fe to Si element ratio, Mg to Si element ratio, S to Si element ratio. The maps are csv files with data that represents the element concentration at each location. They can be found in the following link: https://github.com/strukovas/MLMAPPER/tree/main/data.

The goal of the project was to use machine learning techniques to identify relationships between planetary mapped datasets in order to provide deeper understanding of planetary surfaces and to have predictive power for planetary surfaces with incomplete datasets. Planetary surfaces are observed as all electromagnetic wavelengths (e.g. radar, infrared, optical, ultraviolet, x-ray, gamma-ray), and each wavelength provides unique information about the chemistry, mineralogy, and history of the surface. Yet the information is not entirely independent. For example, the chemical element iron, which is mapped with x-rays and gamma rays, is highly related to optical albedo on the Moon. Knowing this, we can develop high-spatial resolution predictive maps of iron based on optical data. On other planets, the relationships between the observations are less well know, and indeed some datasets are missing. We seek to study planetary surfaces by inputting maps of surfaces at all wavelengths available to discover the relationships between the measurements and to make predictions about chemistry that are not directly sampled by observations. This provides a way of studying the geologic history of a planet with existing data, which is valuable given the infrequent opportunities for new measurements by planetary spacecraft.

The main outcome of the project is an <b>Interactive tool for analyzing the Moon<b> which displays contours around regions of pixels depending on the error value.
